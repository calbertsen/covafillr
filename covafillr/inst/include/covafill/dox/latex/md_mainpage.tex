covafill is a C++ template library for local polynomial regression of covariates in state-\/space models. The covafill library is based on the \href{http://http://eigen.tuxfamily.org}{\tt Eigen} library for linear algebra, and includes several modules. The Core module which provides the base functionality; the Tree module which provides a search tree approximation to local polynomial regression; the Interpolate module which provides classes for cubic interpolation in 1-\/3 dimensions; the J\+A\+G\+S module, which provides a module for using covafill with \href{http://http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/}{\tt J\+A\+G\+S}; and the T\+M\+B module which provides functionality to use covafill with \href{http://tmb-project.org}{\tt T\+M\+B}.
